[MPI version](download/gctb_1.0_mpi_scr.zip)

The MPI version implements a distributed computing strategy that scales the analysis to very large sample sizes. A significant improvement in computing time is expected for a sample size > 10,000. The MPI version needs to be compiled on user’s machine. See [README.html](download/README.html) in the tarball for instructions of compilation and usage. A testing dataset is also included in each tarball.
