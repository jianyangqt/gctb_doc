### About

GCTB is a software tool that comprises Bayesian mixed linear models for complex trait analyses using genome-wide SNPs. It was developed to simultaneously estimate the joint effects of all SNPs and the genetic architecture parameters for a complex trait, including SNP-based heritability, polygenicity and the joint distribution of effect sizes and minor allele frequencies. 

### Credits 

[Jian Zeng](http://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/14033) developed
the software tool with supports from [Jian Yang](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=aLuqQs8AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Futao Zhang](http://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/12709). [Luke Lloyd-Jones](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=WQ0UXOcAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) contributed the BayesR module.
