### About

GCTB is a software tool that comprises a family of Bayesian linear mixed models for complex trait analyses using genome-wide SNPs. It was developed to simultaneously estimate the joint effects of all SNPs and the genetic architecture parameters for a complex trait, including SNP-based heritability, polygenicity and the joint distribution of effect sizes and minor allele frequencies. 

Version 2.0 or above of the GCTB software includes summary-data-based versions of the individual-level data Bayesian linear mixed models previsouly implemented.
