<hr><h3 id="about">About</h3>
<p>GCTB is a software tool that comprises a family of Bayesian linear mixed models for complex trait analyses using genome-wide SNPs. It was developed to simultaneously estimate the joint effects of all SNPs and the genetic architecture parameters for a complex trait, including SNP-based heritability, polygenicity and the joint distribution of effect sizes and minor allele frequencies. </p>
<p>Version 2.0 of the GCTB software includes summary-data-based versions of the individual-level data Bayesian linear mixed models previsouly implemented.</p>

<hr><h3 id="ldmatrices">LD matrices</h3>
<p>The following LD matrices were computed based on 1.1 million common SNPs in a random sample of 50K unrelated individuals of European ancestry in UK Biobank dataset unless otherwise noted.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3375373#.XyFgOS17G8o">Shrunk sparse LD matrix (2.8 million common SNPs)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In the shrunk sparse matrices, described in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12653-0">Lloyd-Jones et al. (2019)</a>, the observed LD correlations computed from a reference sample were shrunk toward the expected values defined by a <a href="https://github.com/joepickrell/1000-genomes-genetic-maps">genetic map</a>, following the algorithm in <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aoas/1287409368">Wen and Stephens (2010)</a>. After shrinkage, LD correlations smaller than a threshold (default 1e-5) were set to be zero to give a sparse format, which is more efficient in storage and computation. </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cnsgenomics.com/data/GCTB/ukbEURu_imp_v3_HM3_n50k.chisq10.zip">Sparse matrix (including MHC regions)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The sparse matrices described in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21446-3">Zeng et al. (2021)</a> were computed by setting the likely chance LD to zero based on a chi-squared test (default threshold at chi-squared test statistic of 10).</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cnsgenomics.com/data/GCTB/band_ukb_10k_hm3.zip">Banded matrix (including MHC regions)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>While the shrunk sparse matrices were used in our original SBayesR paper, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa1029/6039173">Prive et al. (2021)</a> found that using a banded matrix with a window size of 3 cM per SNP can improve prediction accuracy. Therefore, we have created such a LD matrix in GCTB format for SBayesR analysis.</p>
<hr><h3 id="summarydataandpgsweights">Summary data and PGS weights</h3>
<p>The summary data for the 28 approximately independent UKB traits analysed in <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.12.510418v1">Zheng et al. 2022</a> can be downloaded here: <a href="https://plot.cnsgenomics.com/summary/">summary data</a>, and the corresponding PGS weights can be found here: <a href="https://plot.cnsgenomics.com/PGS/">PGS weights</a>. The PGS weights are joint effect estimates derived from ~7 million genome-wide SNPs, therefore it’s important to have matched SNP set between training and validation datasets. This is because if some important SNPs present in the training are missing in the validation, the genetic effects captured by these SNPs will be lost. To maximise the utility of the joint SNP weights, we recommend considering genotype imputation or rerunning SBayesRC with the matched set of SNPs. In addition, note that the PGS weights were estimated using samples of the European ancestry, so they will perform best when applying to individuals of the European ancestry.</p>

<p>Input phenotype data from a plain text file, e.g. test.phen.</p>
<p><strong><span class="kwd">--out</span></strong> test</p>
<p>Specify output root filename.</p>
<hr><h3 id="datamanagement">Data management</h3>
<p><strong><span class="kwd">--keep</span></strong> test.indi.list</p>
<p>Specify a list of individuals to be included in the analysis.</p>
<p><strong><span class="kwd">--chr</span></strong> 1</p>

<p><strong><span class="kwd">--random-covar</span></strong> test.randcovar</p>
<p>Input quantitative covariates from a plain text file which will be fitted as random effects in the model. For a categorical variable with k levels, create a matrix of 0/1 with k columns to indicate the presence of each level in a column.</p>
<hr><h3 id="mcmcsettings">MCMC settings</h3>
<p><strong><span class="kwd">--seed</span></strong> 123</p>
<p>Specify the seed for random number generation, e.g. 123. Note that giving the same seed value would result in exactly the same results between two runs.</p>

<p>Suppress the output of MCMC samples of SNP effects.</p>
<h2 id="bayesianalphabet">Bayesian alphabet</h2>
<p><strong><span class="kwd">--bayes</span></strong> S</p>
<p>Specify the Bayesian alphabet for the analysis, e.g. `S`. Different alphabet launch different models, which differ in the prior specification for the SNP effects. The available alphabet include</p>
<ul>
<li><p>B: Each SNP effect is assumed to have an i.i.d. mixture prior of a t-distribution `t(0, \tau^2, \nu)` with a probability `\pi` and a point mass at zero with a probability `1-\pi`.</p></li>
<li><p>C: Each SNP effect is assumed to have an i.i.d. mixture prior of a normal distribution `N(0, \sigma^2)` with a probability `\pi` and a point mass at zero with a probability `1-\pi`. </p></li>
<li><p>S: Similar to C but the variance of SNP effects is related to minor allele frequency (`p`) through a parameter `S`, i.e. `\sigma_j^2 = [2p_j(1-p_j)]^S \sigma^2`.</p></li>
<li><p>N: nested BayesC. SNPs within a 0.2 Mb non-overlapping genomic region are collectively considered as a window (specify the distance by <strong><span class="kwd">--wind</span></strong> 0.2). This nested approach speeds up the analysis by skipping over windows with zero effect.</p></li>
<li><p>NS: nested BayesS.</p></li>
<li><p>R: BayesR. Each SNP effect is assumed to have an i.i.d. mixture prior of multiple normal distributions `N(0, \gamma_k \sigma_k^2)` with a probability `\pi_k` and a point mass at zero with a probability `1-\sum_k \pi_k`, where `\gamma_k` is a given constant.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span class="kwd">--fix-pi</span></strong></p>
<p>An option to fix `\pi` to a constant (the value is specified by the option <span class="kwd">--pi</span> below). The default setting is to treat π as random and estimate it from the data.</p>
<p><strong><span class="kwd">--pi</span></strong> 0.05</p>
<p>A starting value for the sampling of π when it is estimated from the data, or a given value for π when it is fixed. The default value is 0.05. When BayesR is used, it is a string seperated by comma where the number of values defines the number of mixture components and each value defines the starting value for each component (the first value is reserved for the zero component); the default values are 0.95,0.03,0.01,0.01. </p>
<p><strong><span class="kwd">--gamma</span></strong> 0,0.01,0.1,1</p>
<p>When BayesR is used, this speficies the gamma values seperated by comma, each representing the scaling factor for the variance of a mixture component. Note that the number of values should match that in <span class="kwd">--pi</span>.</p>
<p><strong><span class="kwd">--hsq</span></strong> 0.5</p>
<p>A starting value for the sampling of SNP-based heritability, which may improve the mixing of MCMC algorithm if it starts with a good estimate. The default value is 0.5.</p>
<p><strong><span class="kwd">--S</span></strong> 0</p>
<p>A starting value for the sampling of the parameter S (relationship between MAF and variance of SNP effects) in BayesS, which may improve the mixing of MCMC algorithm if it starts with a good estimate. The default value is 0.</p>
<p><strong><span class="kwd">--wind</span></strong> 0.2</p>
<p>Specify the window width in Mb for the non-overlapping windows in the nested models, e.g. 0.2 Mb. The default value is 1 Mb.</p>
<p><strong><span class="kwd">--var-random</span></strong> 0.05</p>
<p>Specify the prior knowledge on the proportion of variance explained by the non-SNP random effects. This value will be used to specify the prior distribution for the non-SNP random effect variance variable. </p>

<p><strong><span class="kwd">--sbayes</span></strong> R</p>
<p>Available models are R, S and C.</p>
<p><strong><span class="kwd">--ldm</span></strong> test.ldm.sparse</p>
<p>Input the LD matrix generated by <strong><span class="kwd">--make-sparse-ldm</span></strong> option. This option tells GCTB to read two files: a text file that contains SNP information (test.ldm.sparse.info) and a binary file that contains the sparse LD matrix data (test.ldm.sparse.bin). The suffix ".sparse" tells GCTB the format of the LD matrix. The valid suffixes include ".full", ".band", ".shrunk" and ".sparse", which are generated from the corresponding options that make the LD matrix in sush a format, e.g. <strong><span class="kwd">--make-full-ldm</span></strong> for ".full" files. </p>
<p><strong><span class="kwd">--mldm</span></strong> mldm.list</p>
<p>Input a list of LD matrices, e.g. from chromosome 1 to 22. The LD matrices need to be in the correct order in mldm.list.</p>
<p><strong><span class="kwd">--make-full-ldm</span></strong></p>
<p>Compute a full LD matrix from the genotype data provided by <strong><span class="kwd">--bfile</span></strong> option. This option will generate two files: a text file that contains SNP information (test.ldm.full.info) and a binary file that contains the full LD matrix data (test.ldm.full.bin). The full LD matrix contains all pairwise LD correlations between SNPs. The memory required is approximately the size of the n-by-m genotype matrix (4 * n * m)/1e9 GB + the size of the m-by-m LD matrix (4 * m^2)/1e9 GB (n is the number of individuals and m is the number of SNPs). For a more efficient computation, it is recommended to use <strong><span class="kwd">--snp</span></strong> option to compute the matrix by parts. </p>
<p><strong><span class="kwd">--part</span></strong> 5,1</p>
<p>Work only with <span class="kwd">--make-full-ldm</span>. Compute a full LD matrix part by part to save memory. The first number before comma indicates the total parts to divide, the second number indicates the current part to calculate. Run gctb with the <span class="kwd">--mldm</span> output.mldm to merge, after all parts are calculated successfully. </p>
<p><strong><span class="kwd">--make-sparse-ldm</span></strong></p>
<p>Compute a sparse LD matrix from the genotype data provided by <strong><span class="kwd">--bfile</span></strong> option or from the dense type LD matrix, such as full or shrunk LD matrix provided by <strong><span class="kwd">--ldm</span> test.ldm.full</strong> or <strong><span class="kwd">--ldm</span> test.ldm.shrunk</strong> option. If the genotype data is provided, GCTB will first compute the chromosome-wide full LD matrix, then set the chance LD (small LD correlations due to sampling) to be zero and output the sparse matrix. The chance LD is detected by a chi-squared test with the threshold defined by <strong><span class="kwd">--chisq</span></strong>. The chi-squared threshold value is 10 by default. The memory usage is the same as computing a full LD matrix.</p>
<p><strong><span class="kwd">--make-shrunk-ldm</span></strong></p>
<p>Compute a shrunk LD matrix from the genotype data provided by <strong><span class="kwd">--bfile</span></strong> option or from the full LD matrix provided by <strong><span class="kwd">--ldm</span> test.ldm.full</strong> option. It will use the method proposed by <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aoas/1287409368">Wen and Stephens (2010)</a> to shrunk the off-diagonal entries of the sample LD matrix toward zero based on a genetic map provided by <strong><span class="kwd">--gen-map</span></strong> option (see <a href="https://cnsgenomics.com/software/gctb/#Tutorial">Tutorial</a> for the format of the genetic map). Other parameters required by the shrinkage method include the effective population size provided by <strong><span class="kwd">--ne</span></strong> option (default value is 11400), the genetic map sample size provided by <strong><span class="kwd">--genmap-n</span></strong> option (default value is 183) and the shrinkage cutoff threshold provided by <strong><span class="kwd">--shrunk-cutoff</span></strong> option (default value is 1e-5). The output format of the shrunk LD matrix is ".shrunk", which contains all the zero elements, so it will take a similar storage space as the full LD matrix. We recommend to further make the shrunk LD matrix parse by eliminating elements equal to zero for efficient storage and computation, which can be done by reading the generated shrunk matrix and making it sparse using <strong><span class="kwd">--make-sparse-ldm</span> <span class="kwd">--chisq</span> 0</strong> options. The memory usage is the same as computing a full LD matrix.</p>
<p><strong><span class="kwd">--make-band-ldm</span></strong></p>
<p>Compute a banded LD matrix from the genotype data provided by <strong><span class="kwd">--bfile</span></strong> option or from the full LD matrix provided by <strong><span class="kwd">--ldm</span> test.ldm.full</strong> option. GCTB will only compute and include the LD correlations between all paris of SNPs within a sliding window which has a window width defined by <strong><span class="kwd">--wind</span></strong> option (in the unit of megabase). </p>
<p><strong><span class="kwd">--snp</span></strong> 1-5000</p>
<p>Compute the LD matrix by rows (or columns as it is a symmetric square matrix). When this option is invoked, GCTB will read in the genotype matrix from the bed file and compute a part of the LD matrix corresponding to the range of SNPs specified. GCTB will append <code>.snp1-5000</code>, for example, to the output files. Once all parts have been computed individually, make sure to include all the files as a list in the ascending order as a separate file and use <strong><span class="kwd">--mldm</span></strong> option to merge the parts into a single matrix. See Toturial for more detail.</p>
<p><strong><span class="kwd">--gwas-summary</span></strong> test.ma</p>
<p>Input the GWAS summary statistics in the <a href="https://cnsgenomics.com/software/gcta/#COJO">GCTA-COJO</a> <code>.ma</code> format.</p>
<pre><code>SNP A1 A2 freq b se p N

</code></pre>
<p>Columns are SNP identifier, the effect allele, the other allele, frequency of the effect allele, effect size, standard error, p-value 
and sample size. The headers are not keywords and will be omitted by the program. Important: "A1" needs to be the effect allele with 
"A2" being the other allele and "freq" should be the frequency of "A1". See <a href="https://cnsgenomics.com/software/gctb/#Tutorial">Tutorial</a> for more information. </p>
<p><strong><span class="kwd">--chisq</span></strong> 10</p>
<p>Specify the chi-squared test threshold for computing the sparse LD matrix. The LD correlations that are less than the threshold (default value is 10) is regarded due to sampling variation and therefore removed from the LD matrix. It is equivalent to setting the LD rsq smaller than (chi-squared threshold)/(LD reference sample size).</p>
<p><strong><span class="kwd">--ld</span></strong> 0.01</p>
<p>Specify the absolute value of LD correlation threshold for computing the sparse LD matrix. Any absolute value of the LD correlation below the threshold will be set to be zero. It cannot be used together with <strong><span class="kwd">--chisq</span></strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span class="kwd">--write-ldm-txt</span></strong></p>
<p>Output the LD matrix in a text file. </p>
<p><strong><span class="kwd">--annot</span></strong> annotation.txt</p>
<p>Input the genomic annotation data and launch the stratified SBayes analysis (SBayesS-strat). The format of the annotation file is as below.</p>
<pre><code>SNP Coding Conserved DHS Promoter
rs1001 0 1 0 0 0
rs1002 1 0 0 0 0
rs1003 0 0 0 1 1
</code></pre>
<p>The first column is the SNP identifier, followed by annotation categories. The first row is the header line that contains the names of the annotation categories. The current version only allows binary annotations (i.e. 0/1) and only available for SBayesS model (i.e. together with <strong><span class="kwd">--sbayes</span> S</strong> option), which allows the SNP-heritability, polygenicity and the S parameter (relationship between effect size and MAF) to be different across annotation categories.</p>
<p><strong><span class="kwd">--exclude-mhc</span></strong></p>
<p>This option will remove SNPs in the MHC regions (chr6:28-34 Mb) from the analysis.</p>
<p><strong><span class="kwd">--ambiguous-snp</span></strong></p>
<p>This option will remove SNPs with ambiguous nucleotides, i.e. A/T or G/C.</p>
<p><strong><span class="kwd">--maf</span></strong> 0.01</p>
<p>This option will remove SNPs with minor allele frequency from the GWAS sample smaller than the specified value.</p>
<p><strong><span class="kwd">--overlap</span></strong></p>
<p>This option tells GCTB that the LD reference sample is in complete overlap with the GWAS sample. That is, the LD matrix is computed from the GWAS sample itself. This will suppress the modeling of sampling variance of LD correlations in the Sbayes analysis.</p>
<p><strong><span class="kwd">--impute-n</span></strong></p>
<p>This option will impute per-SNP sample size in GWAS based on the GWAS effect estimates, SE and allele frequencies in the <code>.ma</code> file, and remove SNPs with the imputed sample size greater/smaller than 3 standard deviations from the median value.</p>
<p><strong><span class="kwd">--num-chains</span></strong> 4</p>
<p>This option invokes a multi-chain MCMC process, e.g. 4 chains. GCTB will run multiple chains in sequence each with the starting values of the model parameters randomly sampled from their prior distributions. When the MCMC chains are completed, it will calculate the Gelman-Rubin convergence diagnostic (also known as potential scale reduction factor) for each of the model parameters and report them in the <code>.parRes</code> file. For example,</p>

<p>In the current verion, the multi-chain MCMC is only available for SBayesC, SBayesS and SBayesS-strat analysis.</p>
<p><strong><span class="kwd">--rsq</span></strong> 0.9</p>
<p>For a pair of SNPs with the squared LD correlation greater than the specified value, e.g. 0.9, based on the provided LD matrix, this option will remove the SNP with the higher GWAS P value and keep the other SNP in the analysis.  </p>
<p><strong><span class="kwd">--p-value</span></strong> 0.4</p>
<p>This option will remove SNPs with GWAS P value greater than the specified value, e.g. 0.4, from the analysis.</p>
<p><strong><span class="kwd">--robust</span></strong></p>
<p>This option will invoke the following parameterisation for the common factor of SNP effect variance in SBayesR, i.e., \$\sigma_{\beta}^2 = \frac{\sigma_g^2 }{ m {\boldsymbol \gamma}'{\boldsymbol \pi} }\$ where \$\sigma_g^2 = {\boldsymbol \beta} ' {\bf R} {\boldsymbol \beta}\$ is the sampled total genetic variance in each MCMC iteration. Comparing to the original model that assumes \$\sigma_{\beta}^2\$ following a scaled-inverse chi-square distribution, this parameterisation is observed to be more robust to the potential convergence issue which sometimes occurs when the GWAS summary statistics are from a meta-analysis. In GCTB 2.03 beta version, the program will start with the original model but if a convergence issue is detected (indicated by a negative sampled value of residual variance) it will restart the MCMC process with this more robust parameterisation. Note that this parameterisation is identical to LDpred (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/user/identity/landing?code=Ulj9Myn2m9Aa3R2j-wGhgPbv1WF9l5lxSIgHJR3u&amp;state=retryCounter%3D0%26csrfToken%3D325c98ae-e6b3-43c0-b6ea-b6eba8ea096c%26idpPolicy%3Durn%253Acom%253Aelsevier%253Aidp%253Apolicy%253Aproduct%253Ainst_assoc%26returnUrl%3D%252Fscience%252Farticle%252Fpii%252FS0002929715003651%253Fvia%25253Dihub%26prompt%3Dnone%26cid%3Darp-d6cf6a05-621c-472f-b381-5809b9d8a27a">Vilhjálmsson et al. 2015</a>) when using a point-normal prior (i.e., two-component SBayesR or SBayesC).</p>

<hr><h3 id="sbayesrtutorial">SBayesR Tutorial</h3>
<p>This updated version of the GCTB software (version 2.0) includes summary-data based versions of the individual-data Bayesian linear mixed models 
previously implemented. These methods require summary statistics from genome-wide association studies, which typically 
include the estimated univariate effect for each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), the standard error of the effect, the sample size 
used to estimate the effect for each SNP, the allele frequency of an allele, and an estimate of LD among SNPs, all of which are easily 
accessible from public databases.</p>
<p>This tutorial will outline how to use the summary data based methods and accompanies the manuscript 
<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/522961v3?rss=1">Improved polygenic prediction by Bayesian multiple regression on summary statistics</a>. To recreate the tutorial you will need the <a href="https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/2.0/">PLINK 2</a> software and

<h4 id="data">Data</h4>
<p>The tutorial will run through all aspects of the software using 
genotype data from chromosome 22 of Phase 3 of the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature15393">1000 Genomes Project (1000G)</a>. The genotype
data have been filtered to exclude variants with minor allele frequency (MAF) &lt; 0.01, which left 15,938 SNPs available for analysis. 
These data include a subset of 378 individuals of European ancestry from the CEU, TSI, GBR and FIN populations. </p>
<p>N.B. The results generated from this example tutorial using data from the 1000G are designed to be lightweight and should be only used
to explore how to run summary data based analyses using GCTB. The results do not make the best use of GCTB capabilities given the small sample 
size \$(N=378)\$ in the example. </p>
<h4 id="phenotypesimulationandgwas">Phenotype simulation and GWAS</h4>
<p>Using these genotypes, phenotypes were generated under the multiple regression model \$y_i = \sum_{j=1}^pw_{ij}\beta_j + \epsilon_i\$, where \$w_{ij} = (x_{ij} − 2q_j)/ \sqrt{2q_j(1 − q_j)}\$
with \$x_{ij}\$ being the reference allele count for the \$i\$th individual at the \$j\$th SNP, \$q_j\$ the allele
frequency of the \$j\$th SNP and \$\epsilon_i\$ was sampled from a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 
\$\text{Var}({\bf W}\boldsymbol\beta)(1/h_{SNP}^2 − 1)\$ such that \$h_{SNP}^2 = 0.1\$ for each of 20 simulation replicates, 
which is much larger than the contribution to the genome-wide SNP-based heritability (\$h^2_{SNP}\$) estimate for chromosome 22 
for most quantitative traits. All phenotypes were generated using the R programming language with scripts used available in the
<code>pheno_generation</code> subdirectory.</p>
<p>For each scenario replicate, we randomly sampled a new set of 1,500 causal variants. The genetic architecture simulated contained two causal variants of large effect explaining 3% and 2% of the phenotypic variance respectively and a polygenic tail of 1,498 causal variants sampled from a N(0, 0.05/1, 498) distribution such that the expected total genetic variance explained by all variants was 0.1.</p>
<p>For each of the 20 simulation replicates, simple linear regression for each variant was run using the PLINK 2 software to generate summary statistics. Code for running the GWAS and the output is available in the <code>gwas</code> subdirectory.</p>
<h4 id="gctbsummarystatisticsinputformat">GCTB summary statistics input format</h4>
<p>The GCTB summary-based methods have inherited the <a href="https://cnsgenomics.com/software/gcta/#COJO">GCTA-COJO</a> <code>.ma</code> format.</p>
<pre><code>SNP A1 A2 freq b se p N 
rs1001 A G 0.8493 0.0024 0.0055 0.6653 129850

rs1003 A C 0.5128 0.0045 0.0038 0.2319 129830
</code></pre>
<p>Columns are SNP identifier, the effect allele, the other allele, frequency of the effect allele, effect size, standard error, p-value 
and sample size. The headers are not keywords and will be omitted by the program. Important: "A1" needs to be the effect allele with 
"A2" being the other allele and "freq" should be the frequency of "A1".</p>
<p>The transformation of your summary statistics file to the <code>.ma</code> format will depend on the software used to analyse your data. The
 <code>ma</code> subdirectory contains a simple R script for constructing <code>.ma</code> files from PLINK 2 <code><span class="kwd">--linear</span></code> output. There is no need to filter
 you summary statistics to match the LD reference as GCTB will perform this data management for you.</p>
<h4 id="gctblinkagedisequilibriumldcorrelationmatrix">GCTB linkage disequilibrium (LD) correlation matrix</h4>
<p>The construction of an LD correlation matrix is a key component of the summary-data based methods in GCTB. Theoretically, 
the summary-data based methods are equivalent to the individual data methods if the LD matrix is constructed from all 
variants and the individuals used in the GWAS. Calculating and storing LD matrices that contain all pairwise entries is computationally
prohibitive and thus a subset of the matrix entries are stored. Typically, all inter-chromosomal LD is ignored and 
a within chromosome block diagonal matrix structure is used. Futhermore, the individual level data from
the GWAS is not available, which is often the case, and a reference population that is similar in ancestry to the GWAS
cohort is used to construct the LD correlation matrix. The use of a subset of the correlation matrix and the construction
of the LD matrix from a reference leads to an approximation to the individual data mode. The level of deterioration in the
model parameter estimates introduced by these approximations is assessed empirically through simulation, real data analysis
and comparison with individual-data method estimates.</p>
<h4 id="fullchromosomewiseldmatrices"><em>Full chromosome-wise LD matrices</em></h4>
<p>Although possible to create genome-wide LD matrices in GCTB, we recommend to only 
calculate matrices for each chromosome. The following is the basic execution of
GCTB LD matrix calculation. The <code>ldm</code> subdirectory has example BASH scripts to
perform this on a HPC system. N.B. the HPC commands may not be compatible with your HPC scheduler 
and will require alteration.</p>
<pre><code># Build full LD matrix for chromosome 22

</code></pre>
<p>GCTB produces a <code>.bin</code> file, which contains the matrix elements stored in binary, and a <code>.info</code>
file, which looks like</p>

<p>The columns headings are chromosome, SNP identifier, genetic position, physical base pair position, SNP allele 1,
SNP allele 2, frequency of the A2 allele, variant index, for this SNP (row) the first column that is non-zero
in the LD matrix, the last column that is non-zero, how many non-zero elements for this row, difference in
base pair position between WindStart and WindEnd, the sample size used
to calculate the correlation, sum of samping variance of the LD correlation estimate for the SNP and all 
other SNPs on the chromosome and the sum of the non-zero LD correlation estimates between this SNP and 
all other SNPs.</p>
<h4 id="fullchromosomewiseldmatricesusingmultiplecpus"><em>Full chromosome-wise LD matrices using multiple CPUs</em></h4>
<p>To reduce the computational burden of computing LD correlation matrices, GCTB can partition the genotype file
into user-specified chunks. </p>
<pre><code># Build full LD matrix for chromosome 22 for the first 5000 variants 
gctb --bfile 1000G_eur_chr22 --make-full-ldm --snp 1-5000 --out 1000G_eur_chr22
</code></pre>
<p>When the <code><span class="kwd">--snp</span></code> option is invoked the GCTB software will append <code>.snp1-5000</code>, for example, to the output files
so no separate extension to <code><span class="kwd">--out</span></code> is required. </p>
<p>For the 1000G chromsome 22 example the following files are generated</p>
<pre><code>1000G_eur_chr22.snp1-5000.ldm.full.bin
1000G_eur_chr22.snp1-5000.ldm.full.info

<p>The shrinkage estimator for the LD correlation matrix was originally proposed by <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aoas/1287409368">Wen and Stephens (2010)</a>.
The estimator shrinks the off-diagonal entries of 
the sample LD matrix toward zero. <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aoas/1507168840">Zhu and Stephens (2017)</a>
used the shrinkage estimator in their Regression with Summary Statistics (RSS) methodology and showed
empirically that it can provide improved inference. The shrinkage estimator overcomes some of the
issues arising from approximating the full LD matrix in the summary-data based model using a subset 
of the full LD matrix and constructing the matrix from a reference. The GCTB implementation is a C++
port from that provided with the RSS software and has been adapted for use with the GCTB software.</p>
<p>The calculation of the LD correlation matrix shrinkage estimate requires a genetic map. 
The genetic map files can be provided by the user but the tutorial uses interpolated map positions
for the CEU population generated from the 1000G OMNI arrays that were downloaded from
the from https://github.com/joepickrell/1000-genomes-genetic-maps. The file format looks like</p>

<p>and contains SNP identifier, physical base pair position and genetic position (cumulative). 
GCTB can use any genetic map provided it adheres to this format.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, the calculation of the shrunk LD matrix requires the effective population 
sample size, which we set to be 11,400 (as in <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aoas/1507168840">Zhu and Stephens (2017)</a>), 
the sample size of the genetic map reference, which corresponds to the 183 individuals from the CEU 
cohort of the 1000G used to create the genetic map, and the hard threshold on the shrinkage value, 
which we set to \$10^{−5}\$ and is the default value. These three parameters can be changed with </p>
<pre><code>--ne            # Effective population size. Default is 11,400
--genmap-n      # Genetic map sample size. Default is 183
--shrunk-cutoff # Shrinkage hard threshold. Default is 10^-5
</code></pre>
<p>The constuction of the shrunk LD matrix is similar to that for the full LD matrix</p>
<pre><code># Build shrunk LD matrix for chromosome 22 
gctb --bfile 1000G_eur_chr22 \
     --make-shrunk-ldm \
     --gen-map chr22.OMNI.interpolated_genetic_map \
     --out 1000G_eur_chr22
</code></pre>
<p>The GCTB can also perform shrunk matrix calculation using multiple CPUs with a similar
process to the above calculation of the full LD matrix.</p>
<pre><code># Build shrunk LD matrix for chromosome 22 for the first 5000 variants 
gctb --bfile 1000G_eur_chr22 \
     --make-shrunk-ldm \

<h4 id="sparseldmatrix"><em>Sparse LD matrix</em></h4>
<p>Motivated by the computational practicality of not storing the genome-wide LD correlation matrix we wish to set a subset of elements of the 
LD correlation to zero. The calculation of an LD correlation matrix from genotype data is an estimate of the true LD correlation matrix for 
a population. It therefore contains a mix of true LD and those values that differ from zero due to sampling variation, which we wish to 
ignore. By default we ignore interchromsomal LD between markers. Within chromosome, we set elements to zero if their chi-squared statistic 
under the sampling distribution of the correlation coefficient does not exceed a user-chosen threshold.</p>
<p>Specifically, from \citet{lynch1998genetics} the sampling variation of the correlation coefficient \$r = \frac{\text{cov}(x, y)}{[\text{var}(x)\text{var}(y)]^{1/2}}\$ is 
\$\sigma^2(r) \approx \frac{(1-\rho^2)^2}{n}\$, which under the null hypothesis that \$\rho = 0\$ is just \$\frac{1}{n}\$. Given this we can
generate a chi-squared statistic for each element of the LD matrix by \$(\frac{r}{\sqrt{1/n}})^2\$. These statistics should be \$\chi_1^2\$ distributed
and thus for each LD matrix element we set it to zero if the statistic does not exceed a user-specified arbitrary value. The chi-squared
statistic can be altered with <code><span class="kwd">--chisq</span></code>. The default value is 10, which we have found empirically to be a good balance balance between
matrix sparsity and retaining true positive LD values.</p>
<pre><code># Build sparse LD matrix for chromosome 22

<p>We recommend that the shrunk LD matrices be stored in sparse format for efficient
storage and computation. The shrunk LD correlation matrix estimate will have zeroes
which can be eliminated as follows</p>

<h4 id="summary">Summary</h4>
<p>The method implemented in GCTB assumes certain ideal data constraints such as summary data computed from a single set of individuals at fully observed genotypes
as well as minimal imputation error and data processing errors such as allele coding and frequency mismatch. Summary data in the public 
domain often substantially deviate from these ideals and can contain residual population stratification, which is not accounted for in this model. Practical
solutions to these ideal data deviations include the use of data that are imputed and the restriction of analyses to variants that are known to be imputed with 
high accuracy. We found that the simple filtering of SNPs with sample sizes that deviate substantially 
from the mean across all variants from an analysis, when using summary statistics from the public domain substantially improved 
model convergence. However, even the reported sample size cannot be trusted in some summary data sets.</p>
<p>We explored LD pruning of variants to remove variants in very high LD (\$R^2&gt;0.99\$) but found that this did not substantially improve model 
convergence or parameter estimates although this was not formally assessed. However, removal of high LD regions, such as the MHC region 
improved model convergence for real traits. High LD regions are expected to have the potential to
be extreme sources of model misspecification with the model expecting summary data in to be very similar for 
variants in high LD. Small deviations due to data error not expected in the model likelihood at these loci thus have high potential to lead to model
divergence (see Zhu and Stephens\citep{zhu2017bayesian} for further discussion).  We strongly recommend reading the
<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/522961v3?rss=1">current manuscript</a> and that of <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aoas/1507168840">Zhu and Stephens (2017)</a> as a preliminary to 
running the summary data based methods in GCTB.</p>
<hr><h3 id="sbayesrctutorial">SBayesRC Tutorial</h3>
<p>SBayesRC is a method that incorporates functional genomic annotations with high-density SNPs (&gt; 7 millions) for polygenic prediction. Our manuscript is available at <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.12.510418v1">here</a>.</p>
<p>This method is based on a low-rank approximation which utilises the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of block-wise LD correlation matrices. It requires SNPs that are included in the LD reference to be also present in the GWAS samples. Thus, the first step is to impute the GWAS summary statistics for any missing SNPs that are only present in the LD reference. If there are more than 30% of missing SNPs, we recommend to recompute the eigen-decomposition based on a matched LD reference sample (see below).</p>
<h4 id="inputfiles">Input files</h4>
<p><code>ldm</code> is a folder comprising the eigen-decomposition data for each block. We have provided the data from a random sample of 20K unrelated UKB individuals of European ancestry using either ~1 million HapMap3 SNPs or 7 million imputed SNPs, which are available at <a href="https://cnsgenomics.com/software/gctb/#Download">Download</a>.</p>

<pre><code>gctb --ldm-eigen ldm --gwas-summary test.ma --impute-summary --out test --thread 4

<p>This command will generate a text file <code>test.imputed.ma</code> which contains the summary statistics for all SNPs including those from the original GWAS file and those with imputed summary data. Use this file as input for the next step. <code><span class="kwd">--thread</span> 4</code> enables multi-thread (e.g., 4 threads) computing and if it is ignored, a single thread will be used. Before imputation, a QC step is carried out to match alleles between GWAS and reference samples and remove SNPs with per-SNP sample size beyond 3 standard deviation acround the median in GWAS.</p>
<p><strong>Tips for parallel computing:</strong> The imputation step is fully available for parallel computing across blocks and the runtime is expected to decrease linearly with the number of threads, so you can use as many cores as possible in your own computing platform. Alternatively, for the best efficiency, you can impute each block separately by using <code><span class="kwd">--block</span> $i</code> where i starts from 1 to the total number of blocks:</p>
<pre><code>gctb --ldm-eigen ldm --gwas-summary test.ma --impute-summary --block $i --out test

<p>This command will generate a text file <code>test.block$i.imputed.ma</code> for each block. After all blocks are finished, use the following command to merge all <code>.ma</code> files across block into a single file with genome-wide SNPs:</p>

<p>In the case where eigen-decomposition needs to be performed, e.g., the GWAS data is genetically different from our LD reference, or GWAS SNPs are substantially different from our LD reference SNPs, you can use the following steps to generate the eigen-decompostion data based on your own LD reference sample:</p>
<h4 id="step1computeblockwiseldmatrices"><em>Step 1: compute block-wise LD matrices</em></h4>
<p>Skip this step if you are using the eigen-decomposition data provided by us. This step requires individual-level genotype data from LD reference <code>ldRef</code> and a text input file that defines the boundaries of each block. Here, we use text file <a href="download/ref4cM_v37.pos">ref4cM_v37.pos</a> which partitions the human genome into 591 approximately independent LD blocks, each with a width of at least 4 cM, based on the results of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4731402/">Berisa and Pickrell</a>.     </p>
<pre><code>gctb --bfile ldRef --make-block-ldm --block-info ref4cM_v37.pos --out ldm --thread 4
</code></pre>
<p>This command will generate a folder called <code>ldm</code> as specified by <code><span class="kwd">--out</span></code>. This folder will contain a serise of binary files for blocks <code>block*.ldm.bin</code>, a text file for genome-wide SNP information <code>snp.info</code>, and a text file for block information <code>ldm.info</code>. You can use <code><span class="kwd">--write-ldm-txt</span></code> to print the content in the binary file into text file for each block, which will generate another file called <code>block*.ldm.txt</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Tips for parallel computing:</strong> This step can be carried out by computing each chromosome or block separately. To compute chromosomes in parallel using array job submittion (<code>i</code> is the job index), you can do</p>
<pre><code>gctb --bfile ldRef.chr$i --make-block-ldm --block-info ref4cM_v37.pos --out ldm --thread 4
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>ldRef.chr$i</code> is the bed file that only contains data for the ith chromosome (while the ldBlockInfo file <code>ref4cM_v37.pos</code> is still genome-wide). To compute all blocks in parallel, you can do</p>
<pre><code>gctb --bfile ldRef --make-block-ldm --block $i --block-info ref4cM_v37.pos --out ldm
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>ldRef</code> needs to be the genome-wide bed file. Here using a single thread is sufficient.</p>
<p>After all chromosomes/blocks are done, run the command below to merge info files across blocks. Do not need to run this if you are NOT doing chromosomes/blocks separately.</p>
<pre><code>gctb --ldm ldm --merge-block-ldm-info --out ldm
</code></pre>
<h4 id="step2performeigendecompositionineachblock"><em>Step 2: perform eigen-decomposition in each block</em></h4>
<p>Skip this step if you are using the eigen-decomposition data provided by us. The command below will perform eigen-decomposition for each block one by one and store the result in binary format <code>block*.eigen.bin</code> in folder <code>ldm</code>. Again, you can check the file content with <code><span class="kwd">--write-ldm-txt</span></code> which will produce a text file.</p>
<pre><code>gctb --ldm ldm --make-ldm-eigen --out ldm --thread 4
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Tips for parallel computing:</strong> This step can also be done for each block in parallel by using array job submittion:</p>
<pre><code>gctb --ldm ldm --make-ldm-eigen --block $i --out ldm
</code></pre>
<p>No merging is needed after completing all blocks.</p>

<h4 id="iobtainedapoorpredictionaccuracyusingsbayesrwhyisthatandcanitbeimprove">I obtained a poor prediction accuracy using SBayesR. Why is that and can it be improve?</h4>
<p>If the prediction accuracy is unreasonably low using SBayesR, it is likely that a convergence problem has occurred for the trait analysed. Poor convergence will cause the SNP effect sizes to gradually "blow up" (keep increasing toward infinity) and eventually impair prediction accuracy. If you were using GCTB v2.01 or a lower version, you will usually find hsq (i.e., SNP-based heritability) increases to one and SigmaSq (i.e., the variance of SNP effects) keep increasing along with the MCMC iterations, as shown below for example. </p>

<p>At some stage, the program may stop and report the following error message because no SNP can be fitted due to the "blown up".</p>
<pre><code>Error: Zero SNP effect in the model for 100 cycles of sampling
</code></pre>
<p>In GCTB v2.02, we flag the convergence issue by the following message when hsq hits 1 (or equivalently, the residual variance &lt; 0):</p>
<pre><code>Error: Residual variance is negative. This may indicate that effect sizes are "blowing up" likely due to a convergence problem. If SigmaSq variable is increasing with MCMC iterations, then this further indicates MCMC may not converge. Please refer to our website (https://cnsgenomics.com/software/gctb) for further information on this problem.
</code></pre>
<p>Sometimes, even though the MCMC appears to be completed, the posterior means of SNP effects can still be severely biased due to the convergence problem. It is highly recommeded to visualise the scatter plot of the SBayesR estimated SNP effects versus the GWAS marginal effects if you suspect poor convergence. The figure on the left-hand side shows such a scatter plot when MCMC has converged normally. The figure on the right-hand side shows the case when the convergence problem occurred, where some of the SBayesR effect estimates are orders of magnitude larger than the corresponding GWAS marginal effect estimates.</p>
<p><img src="fig/sbayesr_vs_gwas.png" alt="sbayesr_vs_gwas"></p>
<p>Further plotting the SBayesR effect estimates against the physical positions reveals that some SNPs that are in proximity tend to have their effects "blown up" in opposite directions:</p>
<p><img src="fig/sbayesr_snp_effects.png" alt="sbayesr_snp_effects"></p>
<p>The fundamental cause of the failure in convergence is not exactly clear, but it is most likely because of the inconsistency between the LD reference data and GWAS summary statistics or/and errors in these datasets. <strong>We suggest to try the following steps to avoid the convergence problem. Please also see <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/9aougeoxw4ygo8k/AAD6PT3a3ggv1-KYHytbeUNha?dl=0">this doc</a> for a detailed description of processing and running of SBayesR for Locke et al. 2015 and Wood et al. 2014.</strong></p>
<p><em>1. Remove SNPs with extreme GWAS sample sizes.</em></p>
<p>It is implicitly assumed in SBayesR that all SNPs have the same GWAS sample size; otherwise, the residual covariance stucture is misspecified. This assumption is often violated when some SNPs have large genotype missing rates or when the GWAS summary statistics are from a meta-analysis where not all SNPs are genotyped in all cohorts. Below is an example of a highly skewed distribution of per-SNP sample size from a meta-analysis.</p>
<p><img src="fig/yengo_etal_height_snp_n.png" alt="yengo_etal_height_snp_n" width="400" height="300"></p>
<p>In this case, removing the SNPs in the lowest 10% quantile led to a converged result. It is highly recommended to examine the distribution of per-SNP sample size prior to the analysis and remove the outliers with extreme sample sizes. Sometimes, the average sample size is given for all the SNPs. In such a case, one can use the <strong><span class="kwd">--impute-n</span></strong> option in GCTB when running SBayesR, which will impute the per-SNP sample size based on the beta values, SE and allele frquenes and exclude SNPs that have the imputed sample sizes 3 standard deviations apart from the median value.</p>
<p><em>2. Use the shrunk LD matrix.</em></p>
<p>While in principle any type of LD matrix can be used in SBayesR, using the shurnk LD matrix can lead to the most robust result for some traits, such as height. This is likely because the shrunk LD matrix, which is much less sparse than the sparse LD matrix with the default chi-squared threshold, has a better capacity to capture true LD correlations of very small values. Ignoring the SNPs in small LD correlations with the causal variants can collectively cause a bias in the mean of the full conditional distribution of some SNP effects, and subsequently cause the convergence problem. We have provided two shrunk LD matrices based on a random sample of 50K individuals of European ancestry in UK Biobank data, one with about <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3350914#.XyFfnC17G8o">1.1 million HapMap3 common SNPs</a> and the other with about <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3375373#.XyFgOS17G8o">2.8 million common SNPs</a> using a <a href="https://github.com/joepickrell/1000-genomes-genetic-maps">genetic map</a> in the public domain.</p>
<p><em>3. Use DENTIST to detect and remove SNPs with errors in GWAS or LD reference and heterogeneity between the two.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Yves-CHEN/DENTIST/"><em>DENTIST</em></a> is a software that leverages LD among genetic variants to detect and eliminate errors in GWAS or LD reference and heterogeneity between the two. It could be helpful to run DENTIST prior to SBayesR to identify SNPs that have inconsistent LD properties between GWAS and reference samples, and then use <strong><span class="kwd">--exclude</span></strong> option in GCTB to exclude those SNPs in the SBayesR analysis.</p>
<p><em>4. Remove null SNPs based on the GWAS P-values.</em></p>
<p>It can be seen from the above plot of SBayesR effect against GWAS effect estimates that the "blowing up" occures more frequently to the SNPs with GWAS effects close to zero. We have also observed a significant improvement in SNP-based heritability estimation and prediction accuracy when removing the null SNPs based on the GWAS P-values for some traits. For example, as shown in the figure below, removing SNPs with GWAS P-value greater than 0.4 (or lower) in the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3097">Wood et al. (2014 Nat Genet)</a> summary statistics data (after a quality control step on the per-SNP sample size) appeared to fix the convergence problem and led to a substantially improved SNP-based heritability estimates and a higher prediction accuracy. In GCTB, one can use <strong><span class="kwd">--p-value</span></strong> option to specify the upper bound of the P-values of the SNPs to be included in the analysis.</p>
<p><img src="fig/Height_BMI_SBayesR_pt.png" alt="Height_BMI_SBayesR_pt" width="600" height="450"></p>
<p><em>5. Filter SNPs based on the LD R-squared.</em></p>
<p>When the convergence problem occurred, two SNPs in high LD will sometimes blow up effect sizes in opposite directions, as shown in the figure above. Removing one of the SNPs in high LD could be helpful to mitigate the problem. We have implemented <strong><span class="kwd">--rsq</span></strong> option in GCTB to detect every pair of SNPs with LD R-square greater than the specified threshold and then remove the SNP with higher GWAS P-value.</p></body></div>
