How to compile
We have included an example makefile (called Makefile) in the source code tarball. Our program requires two C++ libraries to be included in path: Eigen and Boost. To compile the program, follow these steps:
•  Download Eigen (http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page#Download ) and Boost (http://www.boost.org/users/download/). 
•  Modify their path in the Makefile (the libraries themselves do not need to be compiled).
•  Execute make command. 
A XCode (v7.3.1) project file is also included to facilitate the compilation, execution and debugging of the program on Mac.

The MPI version requires an implementation of MPI libraries (e.g. openMPI, intelMPI, MPICH2, etc). Most implementations have a compiler wrapper, mpicxx, as used in the example makefile. For an optimal configuration on a supercomputing cluster, it is best to consult with the system administrator. To compile on a Mac using XCode 4 or a higher version, follow these steps:
•   Click on the project in Xcode and then click on Build Settings and change the following:
add “/usr/local/include” to “Search Paths – Header Search Paths”
add”/usr/local/lib” to “Search Paths – Library Search Paths”
add “-lmpi -lm” to “Linking – Other Linker Flags”
•   Edit the “schemes” of the project:
change the “Executable” to mpiexec, which is located at “/usr/local/bin”, an alias of “orterun”. Note that “/usr/local/bin” is by default hidden in the Finder. To choose “orterun”, press “command + shift + G” then type in “/usr/local/bin” and press “Go”.
•      Click on “Arguments” in the “schemes” of the project, for running with two processors, add “-n 2” and “$BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR/$EXECUTABLE_PATH” to “Arguments Passed On Launch”
