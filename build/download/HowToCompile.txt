Instruction to compile GCTB MPI version

GCTB MPI version has dependencies on MPI and two C++ libraries i.e. Eigen and Boost.

----
To compile GCTB MPI version on a Linux/Mac system, follow below steps:

1. Download Eigen and Boost;
2. Edit their path in the enclosed Makefile (these two libraries themselves do not need to be compiled);
3. Load an appropriate implementation of MPI library (e.g. openMPI, intelMPI, MPICH2, etc) library (it is best to consult with the system administrator);
4. Switch "SYS" to "LINUX” or “MAC” in the Makefile;
5. Execute make command.

----
We have also included a Xcode (v7.3.1) project file for Mac system. To compile in the Xcode, follow below steps:

1. Click on the project in Xcode and then click on Build Settings;
2. Add “/usr/local/include” to “Search Paths – Header Search Paths”;
3. Add the paths of Eigen and Boost libraries to “Search Paths – Header Search Paths”;
4. Add”/usr/local/lib” to “Search Paths – Library Search Paths”;
5. Add “-lmpi -lm” to “Linking – Other Linker Flags”;
6. Add "/usr/local/lib/libmpi_cxx.1.dylib" to Link Binary With Libraries;
7. Use Command+B to compile.

----
To run GCTB MPI version in the Mac terminal (with the test dataset), use: 

mpirun -np 2 gctb --bfile data/1000G_eur_chr22 --pheno data/test.phen --bayes S --chain-length 1100 --burn-in 100 --out test

An alternative way to run the program with the parameter settings is to use a input parameter file: 

mpirun -np 2 gctb —inp-file test.inp


To run in the Xcode, follow these steps:

1. Edit the “schemes” of the project: change the “Executable” to mpiexec, which is located at “/usr/local/bin”, an alias of “orterun”. 
   Note that “/usr/local/bin” is by default hidden in the Finder. To choose “orterun”, press “command + shift + G” then type in “/usr/local/bin” and press “Go”.
2. Click on “Arguments” in the “schemes” of the project, for running with two processors, add “-n 2” and “$BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR/$EXECUTABLE_PATH” to “Arguments Passed On Launch”.
